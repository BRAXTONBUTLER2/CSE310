# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}
I made a short medival style text adventure game using many loops while learning C#

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I first started by researching a lot about loop s and overall C3 coding pricedure and what it is best for. I then wrote down some things I wanted my game to be able to do, like fight a dragon and use potions, and possibly include ascii art

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- More advanced combat, like diffrent moves
- add stamina so you cant spam moves
- Add more random varilbes, an attack missing or hitting extra hard
